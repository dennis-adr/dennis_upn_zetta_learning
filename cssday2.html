        Iron Man's Suit

            Iron Man's armor is a fictional powered exoskeleton appearing in American comic books published by Marvel
            Comics. It is built and worn by billionaire superhero Tony Stark when he assumes the identity of Iron Man.
            The first armor (which in the story, was created by Stark and Ho Yinsen), was designed by artists Don Heck
            and Jack Kirby, and first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 (March 1963). In the fictional multiverse, the
            appearance of Stark's armor has radically changed over the years, either as a result of modifications made
            by Stark or specialized armors created for specific situations. In real life, it changed as different
            artists took over the series and decided to change it to what they wanted.

                        Created solely for the purpose of restraining Hulk, it is a modular suit that Stark donned while
                        already in another armor, such as the Mark XLIII. It was launched from an orbital tracking
                        platform known as Veronica. It was used by Stark to fight Hulk in Johannesburg.</p>

                        the Battle of Earth. As the previous armor was destroyed by Thanos, Tony Stark made this new
                        version utilizing nanotechnology with enhanced durability as well as new features. It was
                        created, along with thirty-four other suits, during the five years after the Snap.</p>

                        from a Stark Cargo Plane. After initially rejecting the suit, Spider-Man was given the suit two
                        years later during the Infinity War, using it to survive in space and fight Thanos on Titan.</p>
